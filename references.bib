The primary spectrum in the energy range 1016–5 · 1017 eV was reconstructed using characteristics of Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation of extensive air showers (EAS), reflected from a snow surface. Several sources of systematic uncertainties of the spectrum were analysed. A method for separation of the primary nuclei' groups based on the lateral distribution function' (LDF) steepness parameter is presented. Preliminary estimate of the mean light nuclei' fraction f30-150 at energies 3 · 1016–1.5 · 1017 eV was performed and yielded f30-150 = (21±11) %.}
